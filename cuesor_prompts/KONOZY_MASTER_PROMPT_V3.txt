🎯 MISSION CRITICAL: ARCHITECTURAL CONSTITUTION COMPLIANCE
==========================================================
THIS IS NOT A GUIDELINE. THIS IS LAW.
Every line of code MUST pass the Konozy AI Architectural Constitution.

[PHASE 1: THE PURE DOMAIN]
- Location: core/domain/
- Task: Define Entities & Value Objects (Order, Money, ExecutionID).
- Purity: ZERO SQLAlchemy, ZERO Pydantic, ZERO FastAPI.
- Check: 'grep -r "sqlalchemy" core/domain/' must return NOTHING.

[PHASE 2: INFRASTRUCTURE & MAPPING]
- Task 1: Repository Interfaces (ABCs) in core/domain/repositories/.
- Task 2: Static Mappers in core/data/mappers.py.
    * Rule: @staticmethod only.
    * Rule: Bidirectional (to_domain <-> to_persistence).
    * Rule: Recursive mapping for nested collections.
- Task 3: Repository Implementation in core/data/repositories/ using SQLAlchemy 2.0.
- Task 4: Unit of Work (UoW) in core/data/uow.py.

[PHASE 3: QUALITY CONTROL]
- Mandatory Execution: ./scripts/run_architecture_check.sh
- Failure Condition: If violations > 0, REFACTOR IMMEDIATELY.
- Final Step: 'mypy core/' must be 100% clean.

"Build it right the first time. No shortcuts. No compromises."
