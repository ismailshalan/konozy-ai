Updating imports. Since `MarketplaceService` uses `AmazonClient` and `AmazonOrderMapper` that don't exist in the SDK, checking what's actually available and updating accordingly:

Updating imports. `marketplace_service.py` imports `AmazonClient`, but the SDK provides `AmazonAPI`. Updating the import path and class name. `AmazonOrderMapper` isn't in the SDK, so leaving that import as-is. Applying changes:

The mapper import in `amazon_sync_service.py` is from `.mapper`, not one of the three core SDK modules, so leaving it as-is. Checking for other files that need updates and verifying the changes:

## SDK activation complete

### Files updated

1. `core/application/services/marketplace_service.py`
   - Changed: `from core.infrastructure.marketplace.amazon.client import AmazonClient`
   - To: `from konozy_sdk.amazon.client import AmazonAPI`
   - Updated type hints and docstrings to use `AmazonAPI` instead of `AmazonClient`

### Files checked (no changes needed)

- `api/dependencies.py` — imports `AmazonOrderClient` and `LegacySPAPIClient` (not part of SDK migration)
- `core/application/services/amazon_sync_service.py` — imports from `.mapper` (not part of SDK migration)
- `tests/integration/test_spapi_integration.py` — excluded per prompt

### Verification results

- SDK public API imports: `from konozy_sdk.amazon import AmazonAPI, AmazonOrders, AmazonFinancialSource`
- SDK direct module imports: `from konozy_sdk.amazon.client import AmazonAPI`
- SDK instantiation: `AmazonAPI()` works correctly
- No linter errors in updated files

### Import paths now active

```python
# Public API (recommended)
from konozy_sdk.amazon import AmazonAPI
from konozy_sdk.amazon import AmazonOrders
from konozy_sdk.amazon import AmazonFinancialSource

# Direct module imports (also supported)
from konozy_sdk.amazon.client import AmazonAPI
from konozy_sdk.amazon.orders import AmazonOrderParser
from konozy_sdk.amazon.financial_source import AmazonFinancialSource
```

### Notes

- Only `marketplace_service.py` imported from the three core SDK modules (`client`, `financial_source`, `orders`)
- Other files reference wrapper/adapter classes (`AmazonOrderClient`, `LegacySPAPIClient`, `AmazonOrderMapper`) that are not part of the SDK
- The `MarketplaceService` import issue is a pre-existing problem with `core.infrastructure.adapters.amazon`, unrelated to SDK activation
- All SDK imports work correctly
- No business logic was modified — only import paths updated

The SDK is active and ready to use. The new import paths are functional, and the codebase can now use `konozy_sdk.amazon` as the official import path for Amazon SP-API integration.
